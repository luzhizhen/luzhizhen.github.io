_Signalling Legitimacy: Strategic Decoupling of Sanction Compliance Programs in Global Firms_

Abstract: While the compliance of multinational corporations (MNCs) is critical for effective economic sanctions, the economic coercion scholarship falls short in explicating a solid firm-level theory for sanction compliance. Existing studies suggest that MNCs relocate production to third-party states to offset negative impacts of sanction compliance. In this paper, I focus on how businesses leverage managerial strategies to buffer against sanction restrictions. 

Sanction regulators increasingly rely on firms’ self-regulation to monitor and enforce restrictions. Firms are encouraged to set up sanction compliance programs (SCPs) to identify and prevent unapproved transactions or dealings with sanctioned entities. However, these compliance programs do not prevent firms from violating their self-imposed internal risk control rules. When are these self-imposed internal risk control structures effective and complied with, and when do firms decouple on-the-ground practices from formal SCPs?

I build a formal theory of costly signaling where firms use SCPs as a credible signal to regulators. Constrained by enforcement resources and imperfect information about firms’ on-the-ground business operations, regulators take this costly signal in the choice of enforcement levels, which only detect non-compliance probabilistically. Game-theoretic analysis confirms my hypothesized mechanisms. A separating equilibrium, where the firm can signal their types through SCPs, exists only when regulators face a budget constraint. When regulators don’t have information on firms’ actual compliance, firms cannot use SCPs as a credible signal. My theory contributes to the economic sanction literature by offering a firm-level explanation for MNCs’ ceremonial compliance and voluntary disclosure.
